# N-Queens Problem

The N-Queens problem is a classic chess puzzle that challenges placing N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard in a way that no two queens threaten each other. This requires ensuring that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. Solving the N-Queens problem typically involves employing backtracking, a systematic exploration of possible solutions with backtracking when a dead-end is reached.

## Backtracking Algorithm Overview:

1. **Initialization:**
   - Start with an empty chessboard.
   - Begin with the leftmost column.

2. **Recursive Placement:**
   - Place a queen in the current column in a row where it does not conflict with previously placed queens.
   - Move on to the next column and repeat the process recursively.

3. **Backtracking:**
   - If it becomes impossible to place a queen in the current column without conflicts, backtrack to the previous column and try a different row.
   - Repeat this process until a solution is found or all possibilities are explored.

4. **Base Case:**
   - The base case is reached when all N queens are successfully placed on the chessboard without conflicts, indicating a solution.

5. **Visualization:**
   - Visualize the placement of queens on the chessboard as the algorithm progresses.
   - Backtrack when necessary to explore different possibilities.

The backtracking algorithm efficiently prunes the search space by avoiding configurations that lead to conflicts. It explores the solution space in a depth-first manner, trying different combinations until a valid solution is found or all possibilities are exhausted.

Additional optimization techniques, such as constraint propagation and pruning, can be applied to enhance the efficiency of the solution. The N-Queens problem is a fundamental problem in computer science, often used to illustrate various problem-solving techniques and algorithms.
