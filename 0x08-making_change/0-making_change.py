    Given a pile of coins of different values,
    determine the fewest number of coins needed
    to meet a given amount total.

    Prototype: def makeChange(coins, total)
    Return: fewest number of coins needed to meet
    total
    If total is 0 or less, return 0
    If total cannot be met by any number of coins
    you have, return -1
    coins is a list of the values of the coins in
    your possession
    The value of a coin will always be an integer
    greater than 0
    You can assume you have an infinite number of
    each denomination of coin in the list
    Your solution’s runtime will be evaluated in
    this task
